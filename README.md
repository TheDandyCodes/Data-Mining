# Data-Mining
Data Mining subject from MS, Artificial Intelligence Research

## Unit 2 - Data Analysis:
In this second unit, one of the most important parts for working in predictive analytics will be studied, that is, the analysis of data and understanding its behavior. To do this, we will start by manipulating a simple dataset in Python to later try to understand and comprehend its behavior. For this, Python provides us with a series of very interesting functions that we must use at the beginning of predictive modeling work.

In this sense, the topic is divided into the following basic programming concepts:

Standard datasets. We will describe the datasets that we will work with throughout the course and their classification within supervised learning.
Descriptive Statistics. This is one of the most important topics that those who work with machine learning must know. Understanding the data and analyzing its attributes and instances will be the first thing we should observe in any project.
Visualization. Python provides us with a series of graphs to visualize the data and analyze it correctly.
